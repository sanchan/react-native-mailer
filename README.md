An email client application (inspired on [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)) wrote with React Native and Redux just in a weekend ðŸš€

## Note
**This application is completely dummy**

I'm using [react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos) which is not ready for production applications yet, this is just an experiment to try new cool stuff ðŸ˜Ž

## How to run it?
Install `react-native-macos` in your system if you didn't yet:

```
npm install react-native-macos-cli -g
```

Install node packages:

```
npm install
```

Open the Xcode's project:

```
cd react-native-mailer
open macos/Mailer.xcodeproj
```

Run the app from Xcode:

```
âŒ˜ + R
```

or just hitting the Play button.
