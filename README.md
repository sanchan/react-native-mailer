# react-native-mailer
An email client application (inspired on [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)) wrote with React Native and Redux just in a weekend ðŸš€

I'm using [react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos) which is not ready for production applications yet, this is just an experiment to try new cool stuff ðŸ˜Ž

**This application is completely dummy**. Don't expect to replace your current mail client by this ðŸ˜‰

## How to run it?
Install `react-native-macos` in your system if you didn't yet:

```

Install node packages:

Open the Xcode's project:

Run the app from Xcode:
